### About

Extremely minimalist bash autojump

### Install

In your `.bashrc`, source the program:

```
source /path/to/this/git/folder/j
```

### Test run

jumpy stores all your links in ```~/.config/jumpy```

Add a shortcut named ```h``` that will take you home:

```
cd ~/.config/jumpy
ln -s ~ h
```

Show all the shorcuts:

```
j
```

Take a shortcut:

```
j h
```

Everything else:

```
Do it yourself :)
